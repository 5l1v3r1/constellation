<p>The freeze graph view feature has been revised to allow the reset view animation to be performed. This
ensures the camera zooms to show the entire graph as new nodes are added and removed.</p>

== 2017-10-23 New Analytics
<p>New analytics have been added to the Analytic View, and can be found under categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Under Importance, the Connected Component Analytic will tell you the size of each node's graph component, and also indicates how many components there would be if the node was deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's also a new category - Global, with several analytics that will add Graph Attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average Degree - Calculates the average degree of the graph. This metric can be used to detect high
degree nodes.</li>
<li>Graph Density - Calculates the density of the graph.</li>
<li>Component Count - Counts the number of connected components on the graph.</li>
<li>Global Clustering Coefficient - Calculates the global clustering coefficient using the number of
triangles and triplets on the graph.</li>
<li>Graph Distance - Calculates the diameter and radius of the graph.</li>
</ul>

== 2017-10-17 Schema View
<p>The Plugins tab on the Schema View allows you to download a copy of the plugin details into a CSV file.</p>

== 2017-10-13 Schemas
<p>The <strong>Simple Graph</strong> has been renamed to <strong>Visual Graph</strong>.</p>

== 2017-10-12 Map View Update
<p>A few new features have been added to the Map View:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can add custom labels and colours to markers in the Map View using the new label and color menus.</li>
<li>Markers on the map now respond to the 'dim' and 'visibility' attributes. This allows you to, for example, use the
'Dim Other Events' option in the Timeline to visualise locations within a sliding time window.</li>
<li>The draw and measure tools now have support for circles by holding <i>shift</i> as you click. Note that the measure
tool can also measure paths by holding the 'control' key as you click.</li>
<li>The measure tool now supports measurements in nautical miles. The current measurement unit is displayed beside the
measurement tool, and clicking it will cycle through available measurement systems.</li>
<li>You can search for a location on the map by coordinate, geohash or MGRS using the 'Search by Location' option in the
zoom menu.</li>
</ul>

== 2017-10-11 Plugin and parameter names
<p>All plugin names and their parameters have been reviewed and standardised. If you are using the scripting or web server Rest API then please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugin names now end with the <strong>Plugin</strong> suffix</li>
<li>Plugin parameters now follow the naming convention of ExamplePlugin.parameter_name</li>
</ul>

== 2017-09-28 CONSTELLATION Upgrade
<p>CONSTELLATION has been upgraded to work on NetBeans 8.2 and Java 8u144 allowing CONSTELLATION to benefit from the latest security and bug fixes.
We have also re-organised modules and done some house keeping to make it easier to develop and maintain.</p>

== 2017-09-21 Jupyter notebooks may require manual authentication
<p>Until now, starting a Jupyter notebook from Tools &rarr; Start Jupyter Notebook has used the <tt>--NotebookApp.token=""</tt>
flag for ease of use. However, this disables notebook authentication, which is not desirable.</p>
<p>Jupyter is now started using just <tt>jupyter-notebook</tt>, so manual authentication may be required. If it is, follow the
instructions displayed in the notebook's output window.</p>
<p>This now works in exactly the same as manually entering <tt>jupyter-notebook</tt> at a command prompt in the notebook directory
(by default, your home directory).</p>

== 2017-08-29 More Geospatial Export Options
<p>You can now export geospatial data in your graph to a GeoPackage file. This is an OGC defined, GIS compliant SQLite database which is
supported by ArcGIS (and most other GIS tools) and is significantly more flexible than a Shapefile. This export option is available under
File > Export as well as in the toolbar of the Map View</p>

== 2017-08-23 Blaze Menu Changes
<p>There are now more options available for modifying blazes in the right-click menu and toolbar drop-down menu, including three default colour options.</p>
