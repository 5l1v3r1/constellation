        <h1>Extract Words from Content Attribute</h1>
        <p>
            This plugin will extract words from content (that is, words found in the specified content attribute of all transactions) and represent them as nodes on the graph. 
            The source node will be linked to the word by a transaction of type Referenced.
        </p>

        <h2>Parameters</h2>
        <p>
            <b>Content Attribute:</b> Specify which transaction attribute contains the content to be extracted.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Words to Extract:</b> Enter a newline-delimited list of words, and only these will be extracted from content. Otherwise, all words will be extracted.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Extract Regex:</b> Treats the Words to Extract parameters as a list of regular expressions. This parameter is disabled if Words to Extract is empty.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Whole Word Only:</b> Matches the Words to Extract on whole word only. This parameter is disabled if Words to Extract is empty.
